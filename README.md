# Sudoku-Solver
Implements recursive backtracking to solve the classic Sudoku puzzle. See the README file for more information.


Included in this repository are four txt files that have unsolved Sudoku puzzles: puzzle1.txt, puzzle2.txt, mult_sol.txt, and no_solution.txt. 
puzzle1.txt and puzzle2.txt have exactly one solution.
muli_solution.txt has several possible solutions.
no_solution.txt has no solutions.

When prompted, enter the name of one of these files to obtain the solution for that puzzle. The purpose of this project is to highlight the efficiency of using recursive backtracking to solve complex problems.
